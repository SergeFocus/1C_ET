<p>To <a href="Catalog.ДополнительныеОтчетыИОбработки/Help">Additional treatments or reports</a>Designed to work with concrete objects, you can determine the composition of objects that will be available processing commands or report (the team <strong>Appointment processing</strong>). </p>
<p>Teams treatments or reports can be accessed from the list of selected objects, if the flag <strong>Use the form to list</strong> and shape of the object, if the flag <strong>Used to form the object</strong>.</p>
<p>For treatments and reports that are called from the command line interface (not attached to objects configuration):</p>
<ul><li>you must specify the interface section, in which teams of treatments are available to the user via the command <strong>Additional reports</strong> and <strong>Additional processing</strong>
.</li><li>for each command you can specify the users for whom the team will be available by default (the team <strong>Quick access to the team</strong>), And the schedule on which to run scheduled jobs to run this command (command <strong>The flight schedules of the team</strong>).</li></ul><p>Using props <strong>Published </strong>You can enable or disable access to treatment or report to the user. Props can take the following values:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>used</strong> - Treatment is available for use;</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>not used</strong> - Treatment is not available for use;</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>debugging mode</strong> - Treatment is available for use only by the user with the role "Adding or changing additional processing" or the role of "full rights".</div></li></ul><p>Using commands <strong>Upload file</strong> and <strong>Upload file</strong> can update processing in the information database, and to unload it from the database as a file.</p>
<p>As a rule, the majority of the treatments must be carried out in safe mode. It garantriruet that they do not contain any "untrusted" program code that is executed on the server. However, some treatments may require implementation in an unsafe mode. Such treatments should only download from trusted sources (suppliers) or before downloading to independently carry out their audit.</p>
<p>For more information about safe mode, see. Documentation on 1C: Enterprise.</p></body></html>
