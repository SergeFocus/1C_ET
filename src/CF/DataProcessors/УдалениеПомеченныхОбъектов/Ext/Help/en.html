<p>Deleting marked objects available to a user with administrative rights. Removal is performed to control the integrity of the information base. This means that if one or the other system object (document, the directory entry, etc.) referenced by other objects then delete the object will fail. However, it should be remembered that the removal of objects - an irreversible operation. </p>
<p>Removal of previously tagged objects can be done in two ways:</p>
<ul><li>"<strong>Automatically delete all objects</strong> "- An attempt is made to automatically delete all objects that are marked for deletion. 
</li><li>"<strong>Selective removal of objects</strong>"- This mode allows you to select the files to delete. </li></ul><p>Upon completion of the removal of a list of objects whose removal does not hold for the referential integrity of the information base. In this list objects are grouped by type and for each object displayed objects that can not be deleted. </p>
<p>You can edit the objects against the removal of a particular object marked for deletion, and then repeat the removal procedure.</p></body></html>
