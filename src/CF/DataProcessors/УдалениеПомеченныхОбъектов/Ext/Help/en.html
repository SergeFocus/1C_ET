<p>Removal of selected objects available to a user with administrative rights. Removal is done to control the integrity of the information base. This means that if one or the other system object (document, directory entry, etc.) are referenced by other objects that object deletion fails. Nevertheless, it should be remembered that the removal of objects - an irreversible operation. </p>
<p>Removing previously marked objects can be done in two ways:</p>
<ul><li>"<strong>Automatically delete all objects</strong> "- An attempt is made to automatically delete all the objects that are marked for deletion. 
</li><li>"<strong>Selective removal of objects</strong>"- This mode allows you to select the files to delete. </li></ul><p>After the delete lists of objects whose removal does not hold for the referential integrity of the information base. In this list objects are grouped by type and for each object found those objects that prevent its removal. </p>
<p>You can edit the objects against the removal of a particular object marked for deletion, and then repeat the uninstallation.</p></body></html>
