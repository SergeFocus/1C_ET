<h1>Configuring File Technology magazine (logcfg.xml)</h1>
<dl><dt>This treatment is designed to edit the file process log configuration (<strong></strong></dt></dl><p class="Important">The possibilities of this treatment does not allow full use of the opportunities offered by the format of this file in the settings of the event recorded in the production logbook, however, provided enough opportunities to quickly create configuration files that cover a significant part of the needs.</p>
<p>At the opening of processing attempts to open an existing file technological log configuration.File search is performed in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>Catalog<strong></strong> launched version of 1C: Enterprise 8.If the file is found - he was called to the processing and further search prkraschaetsya. 
</li><li>If the file is not found in the directory<strong></strong> located file<strong></strong>, It tries to find the file in the directory specified in this file.If the file is found - it opens treatment.</li></ul><p>With this treatment, you can specify the settings for the dump, memory leaks and control of technological parameters of the magazine.</p>
<p>On the tab,<strong class="ControlElement">Technological log settings</strong> Zavala possible options of forming technology magazine.</p>
<p>On the tab,<strong class="ControlElement">Dump settings and tracking of memory leaks</strong> it is possible to set the parameters:</p>
<ul><li>Building a dump; 
</li><li>Fixing memory leaks on the server; 
</li><li>Fixing memory leaks in the configuration.</li></ul><p>On the tab,<strong>Technological default log and system events</strong> configures the default settings, the formation process of the journal.</p>
<p>It is also possible to form the configuration file templates.</p>
<p>To do this, you must specify the required parameters of the configuration file and run the command<strong>More - Save as template ...</strong> The configuration file is stored in the common configuration files directory named<strong></strong>(Instead of the * character will be replaced by the ordinal number of the template file).</p>
<h2>Work with the editor of the technological log settings</h2>
<p>Consider techniques for working with the editor of the technological log settings.</p>
<h3>Setting the process editor</h3>
<p>Above the editor is a group of parameters<strong>Settings</strong>In this group are given the need to maintain the technological magazine, its location and the period of storage, as well as options that allow you to make the editing process more convenient.The group can be folded, after all adjustments, so that it takes up less space on the screen.</p>
<p>Flag<strong>Forming Technology magazine</strong> controls need to create technological journal "1C: Enterprise" system.</p>
<p><strong>Location Technology magazine</strong> and<strong>The period of storage of history, clock</strong> determine where and how long the process will be stored log.</p>
<p>The right side of the setting group arranged auxiliary controls that allow you to make the editing process more convenient.A group of switches (<strong class="ControlElement">All properties</strong><strong class="ControlElement">Only selected properties</strong> and<strong class="ControlElement">All properties of the selected events</strong>) Determines which events will be displayed in the editor window:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>All properties of the selected events</strong> - A dynamic mode.This shows only those properties that are available for selected events (marked by the very first column).By adding or removing events - ranging composition displayed properties.When displaying ignores the fact that any property can be set for the unmarked column.</div>
</li><li>
<div>
<div><strong>Only selected properties</strong> - In this case will show only those properties for which the mark is set at-least one event log process.Mode is not dynamic.</div></div>
</li><li>
<div>
<div><strong>All properties</strong> - In this case will show all the properties of all event log process.Mode is not dynamic.</div></div></li></ul><p>If you want to display only those events that somehow selected (marked in any column of a specific event), you can do so by using the flag<strong class="ControlElement">Only events marked</strong></p>
<p>With switch<strong>Show description</strong> and<strong>Display name</strong> You can control the way the display of properties and events in the editor.</p>
<dl><dt>
<div>Also, in the bottom of the form otobrazhaemtsya description of the current events (group<strong>Current Event</strong>) And current property (group<strong>Current property</strong>ID of the current event, or property is displayed in parentheses after the matching text.For example, for the event "SQL, Microsoft SQL Server" group header will look like<strong>Current Event (dbmssql)</strong>If this auxiliary information is not needed, it can be removed, turning the group<strong>Additional Information</strong></div></dt></dl><h3>General editing rules</h3>
<p>Editor parameter is a matrix the rows of which are represented in the event that can enter into a process log, and in columns - the properties of these events.</p>
<p>Cells that have a white background and circled frame, perform any action, if you click on them.Clicking on cell causes the mark - the emergence of "V" symbol.Clicking again removes the mark.</p>
<p>If you are a cell in the column marker<strong class="ControlElement">All events</strong> or any column to the right of this column, it is executed at the same time also mark the very first cell in the current event (including in the process of the event log).Removal of the mark does not have such features.</p>
<p>Marking properties for all events (for which this property is defined) is performed using the context menu commands<strong class="ControlElement">Enable for all events</strong>To deselect should use the context menu command<strong class="ControlElement">Turn off for all events</strong>Standing in any line of the column to the selected property.</p>
<p>If you want to assign a condition to an event, this should be done using the context menu commands<strong class="ControlElement">Conditions for the event ...</strong>While in any column of the selected event.If the conditions are set, the mark acquired the form "<strong></strong>"(Marked in bold).To remove the conditions for the event should either delete all events in terms of the editor window, or use the context menu command<strong class="ControlElement">Clean the filter for the event</strong>This mark will remain, but will lose the bold design.</p>
<p>If you want to assign a condition to the events of the property, this should be done using the context menu commands<strong class="ControlElement">The condition on the property ...</strong>While in the cell, which can be edited (white background and frame).If the conditions are set, the mark acquired the form "<strong></strong>"(Marked in bold).To remove the conditions for the event should either delete all events in terms of the editor window, or use the context menu command<strong class="ControlElement">Clear Filter property</strong>This mark will remain, but will lose the bold design.</p>
<p>If you want to clear all the property settings and event log process, select the context menu command EDITOR<strong>Clear parameters of technological log</strong>If yes, the magazine will be set for the registration of all properties for all events.No other parameters of technological log (time of life and the way in technological log directory will not be changed).</p>
<h3>Patterns and their use</h3>
<p>To simplify the creation of configuration files in some typical cases, the process of the journal configuration file editor includes several templates (predefined configuration files) that allow you to quickly perform the configuration file settings.To use the template, select the command<strong>Template...</strong> and in the window that opens, select the required template.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an opportunity to create a configuration file templates.To do this, set the required parameters on both tabs (<font color="#000040"><strong>Technological log settings</strong> and<strong>Dump settings and tracking of memory leaks</strong></font>) And select<strong>All actions - Save as template ...</strong> After setting the parameters of the template, the template file is stored in the directory system configuration files.</p>
<p>Then these templates will also be available in the template selection window when you select<strong>Template...</strong></p>

<h3>Typical operations in the editor technological log settings</h3></dt></dl><p>If you want to include in the technological log all events and all the properties of the event, set the mark for the event "All events" and the property "all property". The file<strong></strong> gets the following text:</p><pre class="SyntaxDescription"><br><br><br><br></pre>
<p>If you want to file always gets design<strong></strong>It is necessary that the property was set to "All Properties" for the event "All events" (not including the event itself).</p>
<p>If you want to include in the technological log all events of a property, it is necessary to note the very first column positioned before the selected property).For example, if the mark is facing property "Microsoft SQL Server", the file<strong></strong> fall following text:</p><pre class="SyntaxDescription"><br><br><br></pre>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to include in the technological log all the properties of the selected event, it should be noted the property "all property" in the required events (the event will be marked automatically, and all available properties of this event will be marked with a special background color).For example, if the column "All properties" was observed in the properties of "SQL, Microsoft SQL Server", then the file<strong></strong> get the following text:</p><pre class="SyntaxDescription" dir="ltr"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>
<p>If you want your event gets in the technological log only if vpolnyaetsya a condition, it is necessary to open the context menu in the event of any column and choose<strong>Terms and conditions for the event ...</strong> As you can set the necessary conditions for the window that opens (for job conditions are available only properties that are present in the selected event).The file<strong></strong> get a text like the following (event<strong></strong> gets into the process in the event log if the property<strong></strong> more than<strong></strong></p><pre class="SyntaxDescription" dir="ltr"><br><br><br><br></pre>
<p dir="ltr">If you want the property fell into the technology magazine for an event only if certain conditions are satisfied, it should be in the line of the required events to stand in the right column and select Properties from the shortcut menu<strong>The conditions on the property ...</strong> (In this case, if this property is selected event).In the window that opens, you can set conditions on the property.The file<strong></strong> get a text like the following (the property<strong></strong> developments<strong></strong> zhurnla gets into the process only when the property<strong></strong> developments<strong></strong> more<strong></strong></p><pre class="SyntaxDescription"><br><br><br><br><br></pre>
<p class="Usual">If you want to include in the technological log a specific property for all events, it is necessary to select a command in the context menu<strong>Enable for all events</strong>The file<strong></strong> get text like this:</p><pre class="SyntaxDescription"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>
<h2>Using the dump settings, tracking of memory leaks and save the query plans</h2>
<h3>Dump settings</h3>
<p>To ensure that the system 1C: Enterprise generate a memory dump when an error occurs, which leads to abnormal zaverschsheniyu the system, you must enable the box<strong>Create a dump when crashes</strong>, Select the location of the file with the dump and its type.In most cases it is enough to leave the dump type, the default (or use the command<strong>The optimal size of the dump</strong> Context dump type edit field menu).</p>
<h3>Settings save query plans</h3>
<p>For preservation of query plans in the technology magazine answers the box<strong>Track query plans (&amp; lt; planSQL &amp; gt;)</strong> and property<strong></strong> Event execution of SQL statements of different databases.Installation of the first box enables the possibility of generating query plans, and turn on or off the properties managed by the availability of information about the plans of queries in their respective events.If you include query plans for preservation, it is recommended to also include property record<strong></strong> for operators execution of events of various SQL databases.</p><pre class="SyntaxDescription"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>
<p>In this example, for the performance of the database server operators MSSQL event (Event<strong></strong>) Is included in the SQL query language texts fixation (property<strong></strong>) And query execution plans (property<strong></strong>Also included is a collection of query execution plans (element<strong></strong></p>
<p class="Important">Obtaining query plans slows down the queries to the database.Slowdown could be significant for some DBMS.</p>
<h3>Memory leaks Settings</h3>
<p class="Usual">For the control of memory leaks meets two settings:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Monitor server memory usage</strong>This should include a conclusion to the process log of all events, including events or separately<strong></strong><strong>Server Memory Leak</strong></div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Track memory leak in the configuration code</strong>In this case, you must specify the areas in which you need to control whether the configuration memory leaks.This can be done by using flags<strong>Checkpoint start / end of code execution on a client</strong><strong>Checkpoint start / end of code execution on the server</strong>And lists to enter information about a controlled modules.This should include a conclusion to the process log of all events, including events or separately<strong></strong><strong>Memory leak</strong></div></li></ul><h2>The default setting of the technological magazine</h2>
<p>Technological default journal - a special kind of technological log for recording of events occurring in critical situations (in terms of the system "1C: Enterprise").To do this, the magazine created a fixed event filter, which forms the platform and which can not be changed.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to adjust<strong>Location System technology magazine</strong> and<strong>The period of storage of history, clock</strong>To set the log storage process parameters default value is the default hyperlink<strong>Set the system configuration process the default log</strong></p>
<p>Using Table<strong>System events</strong> You can specify the details of the recorded events.</p></body></html>
