<p><font size="4"><strong>Processing of green day</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">This treatment is intended for accumulation and verification of the user experience statistics (data acquisition) system based on the platform 1C 8.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The main objective of its use - monitoring (period) states some "indicators", which describes the number of accomplished events.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Convenient when a multi-faceted process of recording data need to keep track of the time "at a glance" on the subject of non-staggered nevvedennyh or operational data.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Here is an example of working with treatment:</font></p>
<ol><li><font size="2">Open processing and specify a period in the header of the window - the period for the collection of statistics.For example, the size of the interval from day - last Monday.It will be as if "the reference period".This, which will be compared with data from other periods.</font> 
</li><li><font size="2">Run on the "Auto-collection and setting parameters" button "Analyze database for a specified period for the automatic generation of a new list of indicators."</font> 
</li><li><font size="2">Before us is a list of some indices derived from your database automatically.Next, open up again changing period in the header of the window - now, as the interval for analysis, - on the Monday of the week and we agree to accept it in the box score.</font> 
</li><li><font size="2">Run the basic routine on the "Perform analysis of indicators."</font> 
</li><li><font size="2">On the "Results of analysis" we see the results of verification of documents, the register records information accumulation registers movements in the new time interval.If deviations higher than normal, they become yellow or red).The percentage of plants of yellow and green plot of deviations is set on the "Auto-collection and setting parameters".</font> 
</li><li><font size="2">Another study sosob suitable for daily indicators - choose a number of indicators in the table and run "Daily analysis of each period of the day" for them.Then, on the "Results of the analysis" to generate a chart (Alt-F3).</font></li></ol><p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Of course, Effectiveness and will be interesting to create more complex "performance" by hand.To do this, you need to specify</font><font size="2">in the column "Indicator Type" by using the "Open" button in the configuration of the available types of documents, manuals, registers and data storage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">In the column "Object Props" with the "open" you can specify the type of props.For example, for a document - props "Responsible".</font><font size="2">Then, in the column "Value props object" you can specify the value of the reference book "Community" - "Ivanov AS".In this case, the indicator will use that selection.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">As you already understood, can be analyzed after the index entry in its "green" the reference period and this value set in the "100% Number of objects".You can output the display of columns in the table of indicators to define their own analysis period.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">It should be noted that the selection of indicators in columns "Start of the study period," and "End of the study period" to RegistrovSvedeny only works for periodic.And for performance directories in the period of analysis is performed only once and will be positioned to the end of the period of analysis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Do not forget to save the processing settings properly when your will prepare a list of indicators!</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Also provided is the ability to save and share your lists via indicators DBF files.The truth in this case is not possible to pass a value parameters details.</font></p>
