<p>Additionally, <a href="DataProcessor.ГрупповоеИзменениеОбъектов/Help">on the front page Assistant</a> You can set specific settings with the command <strong>Configure change</strong>. The system can handle objects in the transaction. If the recording process with the flag <strong>Change in the transaction </strong>can not write to one of the objects (for example, because the object being edited by another user), the change will be canceled in all objects. By default, this box is unchecked. </p>
<p>If the change objects are not in a transaction, it is recommended to perform it with a check mark <strong>Interrupt by mistake</strong>. In this case, if the object record for any reason is not possible, the system will issue a warning and offer to continue to change the remaining objects or interrupt to determine the cause of the problem. If the box is not checked, and the object can not be recorded, the processing will skip such object and will continue to change the remaining objects.</p>
<p>Ticking <strong>Treat the child elements</strong> (default is not checked) allows you to change the child elements of the selected groups and parent objects without having to install the flags of all the elements of groups and child objects. If unchecked, the system processes the group itself, not its children.</p></body></html>
