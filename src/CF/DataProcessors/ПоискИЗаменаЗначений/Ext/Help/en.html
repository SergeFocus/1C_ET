<h1>Search and replace values</h1>
<p>Universal processing "Finding and replacing values" is intended for search and replacement of the reference values ​​in different information base objects of 1C: Enterprise.</p>
<p>The need for such an operation may occur, for example if the same counterparty entered twice in the process of contracting a reference in error and both values ​​have been used in various documents.In this case, before you remove one of the elements of the directory should be corrected all the documents (and other items, if any) in which this element is used.This treatment makes it possible to perform such a procedure automatically.</p>
<p class="Important">ATTENTION!!!<br>Treatment replaces the value in the information database objects in a universal manner.It does not take into account the specific features of the configuration.Using processing can disrupt logical relationship values ​​of the objects, which is supported configuration for manual adjustment of values.</p>
<p class="Important">It is recommended before using the treatment to make a backup copy of the information base.After using the treatment, make sure that the changes have been made correctly and did not cause disturbances in the logic of the data objects, which involves the exchange of values.If necessary, you must manually change the data values ​​depend on the values ​​of the modified treatment.</p>
<p>To replace should populate the list of values ​​of pairs of "substitute objects". As the value of "What to replace" you can select the directory item that is entered incorrectly, and as the value of "What to replace" - the element that really has to be used in documents, directories and other sites.</p>
<p>In the list of "substitute objects" by double-clicking or by pressing the Enter key<br>you can open the value at the cursor position.</p>
<p>Next, press the button "Search Links".The program will search for objects (documents, manuals, etc.) which were used value selected under "What to replace."The search may take a long time.</p>
<p>The list of references can be found to cancel the replacement of the current pair of values ​​for individual objects.To do this, turn off the appropriate boxes on the list.</p>
<p>To replace values ​​should click "Run replacement values."The program will attempt to replace the values ​​in those facilities, replacement of which has not been abolished.</p></body></html>
