<p>Management includes the results of the procedures related to the outcome of the accumulation and accounting registers, as well as units of current accumulation registers. Control the outcome is divided into two modes:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="#Simple">Private use possible</a></strong>
 - Allow "one touch" to perform the most common actions arising from the maintenance of the system. </li><li><strong><a href="#Full">Full opportunities</a></strong> - It allows to perform all operations as a single register, or a random list of registers.</li></ul><p>To switch serves as a hyperlink in the lower right corner of the form. The form stores open mode.</p>
<h2><a name="#Simple">Frequently used features</a></h2>
<h3>Operations with results</h3>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Set between the calculated results of</strong> - To speed up the system installs the period calculated for the outcome of accumulation and accounting registers with the included outcome. To register storage - at the end of the previous month for the accounting registers - at the end of the month.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Enable the use of the results of</strong> - Involves the use of the results of all the registers in which the mode is switched off (for example as a result of a crash of any procedure, disable the use of outcome).</div></li></ul><h3>Operations units</h3>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Rebuild and fill</strong> - For all the accumulation of circulating registers, which enabled units and found their use, performs a rebuild using the machine and performs the filling units. The operation may be performed for a long time.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Get the best units</strong> - Retrieves a list of the best units for the accumulation of circulating registers, which are specified in the Configurator units. You will be prompted directory where will be stored xml-files with lists of the best units. Each file will be named identifier corresponding register. So, to register <strong>The sale</strong> file will be named <strong>Prodazhi.xml</strong>.</div></li></ul><h2><a name="#Full">Full opportunities</a></h2>
<p>In the full features available multiple selection mode. Any action is applied to all selected objects, or to the fact on which the cursor.</p>

<div>calculate a list of the best units. You will be prompted directory where will be stored xml-files with lists of the best units. Each file will be named identifier corresponding register. So, to register <strong>The sale</strong> file will be named <strong>Prodazhi.xml</strong>. After the operation, the list of registers are highlighted in bold are registers for which you want to update the list of units to calculate the optimum units. Updates must be performed in the Configurator.</div></li></ul><p>At the bottom of the form displays a list of units register at the cursor position in the top list.</p>
<p>The list includes only those registers current accumulation registers, in which the current user is set right <strong>Management outcome</strong> Configurator and set assemblies.</p></body></html>
