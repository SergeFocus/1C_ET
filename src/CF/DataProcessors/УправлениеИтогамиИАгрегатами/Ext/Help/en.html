<p>The results of management includes procedures related to the outcome of the accumulation and accounting registers as well as units of current accumulation registers.The results of the management is divided into two modes:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="#Simple">Private use possible</a></strong> - Allow "one touch" to perform the most common actions arising from the maintenance of the system. 
</li><li><strong><a href="#Full">Full opportunities</a></strong> - It allows to perform all operations with a single register or register with an arbitrary list.</li></ul><p>To switch between modes is a hyperlink in the lower right corner of the form.The form stores open mode.</p>
<h2><a name="#Simple">Frequently used features</a></h2>
<h3>With the results of operations</h3>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Set between the calculated outcome</strong> - To speed up the system installs the period calculated for the results of all the accumulation and accounting registers enabled outcome.For storage registers - at the end of the previous month, for accounting registers - at the end of this month.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Enable the use of the results of</strong> - Involves the use of the results of all the registers, in which the mode is switched off (for example as a result of a crash of any procedure that disables the use of the results).</div></li></ul><h3>Operations with units</h3>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Rebuild and fill</strong> - All revolving accumulation registers, which included units mode and found their use, performs an operation to rebuild the use of aggregates, and performs filling units.The operation can be performed for a long time.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Get the best units</strong> - Retrieves a list of the best units for all circulating accumulation registers, which are set in the Configurator units.You will be prompted directory where you saved xml-files with lists of the best units.Each file will be named identifier corresponding register.So, to register<strong>The sale</strong> the file will be called<strong>Prodazhi.xml</strong></div></li></ul><h2><a name="#Full">Full opportunities</a></h2>
<p>At full capacity available multiple selection mode.Any action is applied to all selected objects, or to where the cursor is.</p>
