<h1>Processing "Unloading and loading XML"</h1>
<h2>Modes of operation</h2>
<p>Processing implements two modes of operation: Landings (create a file upload user-specified data) and Downloads (reading a file upload, the same name created by the regime, and write it in the available data). Setting is carried out in the selection mode.</p>
<p>Before starting a particular mode (press the Run button), you need to specify the name of the file upload or by entering it manually in the "File name" or select it using the button field and standard file dialog.</p>
<p>In the boot there is a possibility of using the results of the edit recording registers that can affect the download speed.<br>Buttons "Disable the results" and "Include the results" are available when the flag is set "Enable the ability to edit the results of the use during the loading of data" and are used for manual operation mode of use of the results of boot data. </p>
<h2>Terms and conditions of applicability of treatment</h2>
<p>Processing can only be used in cases where the information base, in which the discharge data and the one in which data is loaded, are homogeneous (configuration identical data can vary), or all the discharged objects are almost completely identical in composition and type details and table parts, properties "host" object metadata, etc. It should be noted that, in connection with these constraints, the processing is mainly intended for exchange between homogeneous IB.</p>
<p>File format is different from the unloading file format created during unloading plan exchange chapeau. To download data (elements directories, registers and records of sets, etc.) treatment uses the same XML-serialization mechanism that discharge plans for the exchange, in this part of the file formats are identical.</p>
<h2>Determination of discharge</h2>
<p>Processing allows both full and partial unloading of the data base information to a file. Adjusting the composition of the uploaded data is done in a dialogue by setting flags in the column of a tree that displays the metadata objects for which data can be downloaded. Additional column flags, "if necessary", establishes the need to unload objects of this type "link". That is, if the box is checked only in the "if necessary", the data for this object will not be discharged in full, and only to the extent that is needed to maintain referential integrity in the information base, which will download the file upload.</p>
<p>When you open a form processing sets the link flag to upload all of the objects that ensures referential integrity discharged fragment of information base. </p>
<p>By clicking on the "Define data unloaded on the link" processing analyzes, references to which may be contained in the objects that have the sign of a complete discharge and automatically fills in the column of flags that indicate the need to unload here. If the object already has a box full set discharging, then check unloading link is not established.</p>
<h1>Possible applications</h1>
<p>Using this processing may, for example, to create a full or partial backup data of the data exchange between the information databases, as well as an auxiliary tool in the reduction of the problem of information databases.<br></p></body></html>
