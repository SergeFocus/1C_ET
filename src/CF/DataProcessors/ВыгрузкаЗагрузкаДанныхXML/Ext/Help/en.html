<h1>Processing "Unloading and loading XML data"</h1>
<h2>Modes of operation</h2>
<p>Processing implements two modes of operation: Landings (the creation of these data by the user upload a file) and load (unload reading file created eponymous mode, and recording the data available in it). Setting the mode by choosing the Mode field.</p>
<p>Before starting this or any other mode (press the Run button), you need to specify the name of the file upload or by entering it manually in the "File Name", or using the button select this field and standard file selection dialog.</p>
<p>In boot mode, it is possible to modify the results of the use of registers at entry, which can affect download speeds.<br>Buttons "Disable the results" and "Include the results" are available when the flag is set to "Enable the ability to edit the results of the use during data download" and are used for manual control of the results of use when loading data.</p>
<h2>Processing conditions for the applicability</h2>
<p>It should be noted that, in connection with these constraints, the processing is mainly intended for exchange between homogeneous IB.</p>
<p>The file format is different from discharging file format created during unloading plan exchange, the title part.To download data (elements guides, sets of registers and records, etc.) treatment using the same XML-serialization mechanism that discharge for the exchange of plans in this part of the file formats are identical.</p>
<h2>Determination of the composition of the discharge</h2>
<p>Processing allows for both full and partial unloading of the data base information to a file.Setting composition data is unloaded in the dialogue by setting flags in the wood column that displays the metadata objects for which data can be downloaded. Additional column flags "if necessary", establishes the need for unloading objects of this type "link".That is, if the box is checked only in the "if necessary", the data for this object will not be discharged in full, and only to the extent that is necessary to maintain referential integrity in the information base, which will load the file upload.</p>
<p>When you open a form processing sets the flag to upload the link to all the objects that ensures referential integrity discharged fragment of information base.</p>
<p>By clicking on the button "Define the data, upload the link" processing analyzes, references to which data can be kept in facilities that have installed a sign of complete discharge, and automatically fills in the column of flags that indicate the need to upload the link.If the object already has a set of full discharge box, in this case, the discharge check the link is not established.</p>
<h1>Possible applications</h1>
<p>The use of this treatment may, for example, to create a full or partial backup data of the data exchange between data bases, as well as an auxiliary tool in the reduction of the problem of information databases.<br></p></body></html>
